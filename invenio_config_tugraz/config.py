This is used to configure for instance the database connection pool.
Specifically for connection pooling the following options below are relevant.
Note, that the connection pool settings have to be aligned with:

1. your database server's max allowed connections settings, and
2. your application deployment (number of processes/threads)

**Disconnect handling**

Note, it's possible that a connection you get from the connection pool is no
longer open. This happens if e.g. the database server was restarted or the
server has a timeout that closes the connection. In these case you'll see an
error similar to::

    psycopg2.OperationalError: server closed the connection unexpectedly
        This probably means the server terminated abnormally
        before or while processing the request.

The errors can be avoided by using the ``pool_pre_ping`` option, which will
ensure the connection is open first by issuing a ``SELECT 1``. The pre-ping
feature however, comes with a performance penalty, and thus it may be better
to first try adjusting the ``pool_recyle`` to ensure connections are closed and
reopened regularly.
