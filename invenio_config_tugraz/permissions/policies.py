"""TU Graz permission-policy for invenio services.

To use, set these config-variables:
  `RDM_PERMISSION_POLICY` to `TUGrazRDMRecordPermissionPolicy`
  `COMMUNITIES_PERMISSION_POLICY` to `TUGrazCommunityPermissionPolicy`

Policies list **what actions** can be done **by whom**
over an implied category of objects (typically records). A Policy is
instantiated on a per action basis and is a descendant of `Permission
<https://invenio-access.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html
#invenio_access.permissions.Permission>`_ in
`invenio-access <https://invenio-access.readthedocs.io>`_ .
Generators are used to provide the "by whom" part and the implied category of
object.

Actions are class variables of the form: ``can_<action>`` and the
corresponding (dis-)allowed identities are a list of Generator instances.
One can define any action as long as it follows that pattern and
is verified at the moment it is undertaken.
